====================================
 Facebook Authentication Module 0.3
         For SilverStripe
====================================
Developed and maintained by RentBox

====================================

This module is (currently) not a simple drop in module.

Requirements:
* Facebook application id/secret
	- https://www.facebook.com/developers/apps.php

Installation:
- Extract facebook folder to your site root
- Provide your application id/secret using the provided methods
	(FacebookCallback::set_facebook_id/secret)
- Run /dev/build

This adds two extra fields to the Member table, FacebookID and FacebookName.
OAuth tokens *are not* stored. You can not use this module for communicating
with Facebook beyond the sign in process.

This module currently does not provide a way for users to set these values.
YOU MUST PROVIDE THIS USING THE AVAILABLE METHODS.

This is done by providing a way for users to call connectUser() on a
FacebookCallback object. This method is not accessible via a URL so you
must provide this. An action that returns
singleton('FacebookCallback')->connectUser($this->Link('FinishFacebook'))
should be all that is needed. The argument to connectUser() is the URL to
redirect to once the Member record has been updated.
