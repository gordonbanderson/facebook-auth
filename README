====================================
 Facebook Authentication Module 1.1
         For SilverStripe
====================================
Developed and maintained by RentBox

====================================

This module is (currently) not a simple drop in module.

Requirements:
* Facebook application id/secret
	- https://www.facebook.com/developers/apps.php

Installation:
- Extract facebook folder to your site root
- Provide your application id/secret using the provided methods
	(FacebookCallback::set_facebook_id/secret)
- Run /dev/build

This adds two extra fields to the Member table, FacebookID and FacebookName.
OAuth tokens *are not* stored. You can not use this module for communicating
with Facebook beyond the sign in process.

This module adds a button to MemberFormFields, but not FrontendField. You can
 your own button as well. For an example of how to do so, have a look at
FacebookIdentifier, facebook.js and the three related methods in FacebookCallback.
